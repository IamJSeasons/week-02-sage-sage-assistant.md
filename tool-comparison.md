# AI Tool Comparison — Updated Week 2

## My Current Tool Rankings (for my needs)

| Rank | Tool    | Best For                          | Limitations                              |
|-------|---------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1     | SAGE    | Clear explanations and practice questions | Sometimes too wordy, occasionally gives full answers without hints |
| 2     | Claude  | Concise explanations and creative ideas    | May not always ask clarifying questions |
| 3     | Gemini  | General knowledge and versatile tasks       | Limited access and slower response times |

## What Changed Since Last Week
After building SAGE, I realized how important system instructions are to guide the AI’s behavior. I learned that clear rules help prevent unwanted full answers. I also learned to use clarifying questions to improve understanding.

## Rate Limit Experience
I did not hit any rate limits during my testing. I understand that some platforms limit requests per minute, so I plan to pace my queries and avoid too many in a short time.
