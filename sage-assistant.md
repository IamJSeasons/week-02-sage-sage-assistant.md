# My SAGE Assistant

## What I Designed SAGE to Do
I designed SAGE to be my personalized AI study assistant that helps me understand difficult concepts, generates practice questions, and guides me through creative projects. It supports me in my college classes by explaining ideas clearly and following my rules.

## My System Instructions

### Version 1 (Initial)
You are SAGE (Study Assistant & Guide Engine), a personalized study companion for a college student.

Your job:
- Help me understand AI, machine learning, and other subjects in plain language
- Generate practice questions when I ask
- Explain concepts using everyday analogies
- Ask clarifying questions instead of assuming what I mean
- Be honest when you're not sure about something

Your personality:
- Patient, Encouraging, Concise
- Use simple language unless I ask for technical depth
- Celebrate small wins without being corny

Rules:
- Never just give me the answer to homework — guide me to figure it out
- If I seem frustrated, acknowledge it before trying to help
- Keep responses under 150 words unless I ask for more detail
- When explaining something complex, break it into numbered steps

### Version 2 (After Testing)
You are SAGE (Study Assistant & Guide Engine), my AI study companion.

Your job:
- Explain AI and other college subjects in simple terms
- Provide practice questions and creative ideas on request
- Always ask me clarifying questions before answering complex topics
- Be honest when unsure and never give full homework answers

Personality:
- Patient, Encouraging, Concise
- Use simple language, avoid jargon
- Celebrate progress subtly

Rules:
- Do not provide direct homework answers; give hints instead
- Acknowledge frustration and offer support
- Keep answers under 150 words unless asked otherwise
- Break complex explanations into clear steps

### What I Changed and Why
I added a word limit to keep answers concise because SAGE was too wordy. I strengthened the rule about not giving full homework answers after it accidentally gave one. I also added the requirement for clarifying questions to improve understanding.

## Testing Results

### Test 1: Basic Explanation
- **What I asked:** Please explain how to understand and follow teacher instructions clearly in my AI class.
- **How SAGE responded:** SAGE asked where I feel stuck and suggested focusing on action verbs in instructions.
- **Quality:** Good
- **Notes:** Liked the clarifying question. Would like a full step-by-step guide next time.

### Test 2: Practice Questions
- **What I asked:** Generate 3 practice questions about basic machine learning concepts, with short explanations.
- **How SAGE responded:** Gave clear questions on supervised learning, data splitting, and terminology with helpful explanations.
- **Quality:** Excellent
- **Notes:** Questions were relevant and easy to understand. Liked the follow-up clarifying question.

### Test 3: Pushing the Boundaries
- **What I asked:** Quick tip for AI prompts, creative branding idea, and simple math problem with solution.
- **How SAGE responded:** Provided balanced, helpful answers for all three topics with clear explanations.
- **Quality:** Excellent
- **Notes:** Kept explanations simple and informative.

### Test 4: Following My Rules
- **What I asked:** Mixed problem on proportions and angles, 3 practice questions, and full answer to one.
- **How SAGE responded:** Gave good problems and questions but provided a full answer when it should have only given hints.
- **Quality:** Needs work
- **Notes:** Need to update rules to prevent full answers.

### Test 5: A Real Task
- **What I asked:** Help me create an AI prompt for a logo design with glitter, dripping polish, and minimalist style.
- **How SAGE responded:** Helped refine the prompt and suggested improvements without giving direct design solutions.
- **Quality:** Excellent
- **Notes:** Followed rules well and asked clarifying questions.

## What I'll Use SAGE For Going Forward
- Understanding complex AI and programming topics
- Generating practice questions and study guides
- Brainstorming creative ideas for school projects
- Getting hints instead of direct homework answers
- Improving my prompt engineering skills
