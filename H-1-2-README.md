#### Week 2: Building My SAGE Assistant  
**Date:** 2026-02-07 to 2026-02-09  

**What I built:**  
I built a personalized AI assistant named SAGE to help me study a variety of subjects including math, AI, graphic design, and branding by explaining concepts simply, generating practice questions, and guiding creative projects.  

**What I learned about prompt engineering:**  
- Clear system instructions are essential to control AI behavior.  
- Including clarifying questions makes AI responses more interactive and helpful.  

**What challenged me:**  
Keeping the assistant from giving full homework answers was difficult and required refining instructions multiple times.  

**What I'm proud of:**  
I created detailed prompts and tested my assistant thoroughly to improve its helpfulness.  

**Questions I still have:**  
How can I make SAGE better at handling very technical or jargon-heavy topics?  
How do I balance brevity and detail in AI responses?
