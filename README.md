# Project Overview

This repository contains my work building a personalized AI study assistant called SAGE. The project focuses on creating effective prompts, refining system instructions, and testing the assistant to improve its ability to explain concepts clearly, generate practice questions, and support creative tasks.

- Created a prompt library with practical prompts for learning, building, and evaluating  
- Reflected on challenges like preventing full homework answers and balancing clarity with brevity  
- Developed skills in prompt engineering and AI interaction design
